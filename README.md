# ISMRecipeWebscraper
Webscrapes a bunch of recipes to later use in my website (recipes will be cited)
Small issue, did not setup git correctly the first time. This was started 10/2/2023. The first commit was just the code from my first webscraper. Since then I changed some elements and added more code so that this can read a whole page
